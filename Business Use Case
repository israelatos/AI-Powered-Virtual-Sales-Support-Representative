## **AI-Powered Virtual Sales & Support Representative**

### **Business Use Case**
Companies often struggle with managing customer interactions efficiently across sales, support, and service channels. Human sales reps and support engineers can only handle a limited number of conversations, often leading to missed leads, slow response times, and poor customer experiences. 

Your AI-powered application will serve as an intelligent virtual representative capable of:  
âœ… Engaging potential customers via voice and chat like a human  
âœ… Making outbound sales calls to pitch products/services  
âœ… Generating leads and identifying business opportunities  
âœ… Conducting follow-ups to nurture leads and close deals  
âœ… Handling customer service inquiries and troubleshooting technical issues  
âœ… Creating and managing incident tickets for escalations  
âœ… Integrating with CRMs (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot) and ticketing systems (e.g., Zendesk, ServiceNow)
